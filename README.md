To get the project to run, you need to copy the debug/release .dll files into the correct "out" directory for whatever build you are running.
ie: Debug x64 build needs all the dll files with "-d" in their name copied into the bin\out\debug\ directory. Otherwise you'll receive a runtime error
when the program is launched.
